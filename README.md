# News Aggregator

News Aggregator is a simple project that utilizes PHP Laravel 8.0 as the backend and ReactJS as the frontend to provide an efficient news aggregation platform. The project aims to gather news articles from three different APIs and manipulate them using the PHP Laravel backend, making the data ready to be consumed by the ReactJS frontend.

## Features

- **News Aggregation**: The project collects news articles from three separate APIs (OpenAPI, The Guardian and New York Times), allowing users to access a diverse range of news from various sources.
- **Backend API**: PHP Laravel 8.0 is used as the backend framework to provide a reliable and efficient API for handling news data. The backend processes and manipulates the data to ensure optimal usability on the frontend.
- **Frontend Interface**: ReactJS is employed as the frontend technology to create a user-friendly interface for browsing and consuming news articles. The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Dockerized Environment**: This project is fully dockerized, allowing for easy setup and deployment. With Docker, you can ensure consistency and portability across different environments, making it convenient to run the application on any system.
